# Todo-Application

Created a Todo app that lets you enter a prodcut name and the price and display it. Also lets you update the product by removing the product if there isnt anymore more of that product and replace it with another product. Uses Node.js, and MongoDB(to display the records of each product in the databases). Also uses express js, nodemon, etc. for now I will post it here and once I get a chance I will make it visible on the web. Enjoy 

you need to use localhost:2010 to use the app on browser and in inside Visual Studio you need to run the follwoing command: nodemon app.js.
